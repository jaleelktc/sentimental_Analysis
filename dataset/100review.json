While in Italy, Dermot and Nuala Anne meet fellow Chicago resident Seamus Costelloe and his family.  After unceremoniously dumping Seamus into the pool for insulting his wife, Dermot and Nuala Anne agree to joining the Costelloe brood for dinner.  Nuala Anne noticed the mark of death on Seamus, a blowhard with many enemies not all in organized crime.Meanwhile the couples' daughter hears the explosion associated with the Windy City's Haymarket Riot.  The only problem is that the incident occurred over a century ago.  To provide solace to his daughter who believes that someone is crying for fairness through her, Dermot tries to uncover the truth over who really started the riot.  Meanwhile Nuala Anne, perhaps being the only person to see any good in Seamus, tries to keep him alive as she believes that is why her Irish fey powers gave her the sign.The latest Nuala Anne tale is a fun to read story because the two lead characters are a delight to watch in action even if she is a too perfect Irish goddess.  The dual story lines require leaps of faith as the audience will struggle with why Nuala Anne feels obligated to protect Seamus and why Dermot believes he must solve the Haymarket Riot mystery.

He earns a minor living distributing sheets for the low life casinos.  However, when Betty, as he calls his mother, is killed, Zack leaves town.

There are two competing mining companies that are looking for dominance: Intergalactic Ore and Lommite Limited (abbreviated LL throughout the book). Intergalactic has been sabotaging LL's ships and the recent one (closer to the beginning of the book) caused a lot of damage and enraged the CEO of the company.

In general, you really do not &quot;get into&quot; the character of Darth Maul all that much in this story. Given its short length, there was not a lot of time for great characterization. Also, some of Darth Maul's actions seem a little odd in the normal context of Jedi activities. For example, when he &quot;twirls&quot; himself rapidly enough to bury himself in a snow bank. However, other scenes of Darth Maul in action are pretty cool and indicative of what a Jedi could probably do. (Then again, who am I to say what a Jedi can and cannot do. I just think you have to be careful with &quot;super-power beings&quot; because you run the risk of making their actions seem almost comical rather than scary or awe-inspiring.)Although very short (probably necessary right now for digital books), I liked the story and, if nothing else, it did fill in some of the pre-Phantom Menace storyline to see the machinations of Darth Sidious as he begins his plans for galactic subjugation.This story in style and plotting was, to me, somewhat like the &quot;Jedi Apprentice&quot; series - which is by no means a bad thing. This is probably not a necessary buy for you unless you are a die-hard Star Wars fan that must own everything about it - or if you are someone who just likes to have as many gaps filled in as possible.

In fact, though, it takes place more than six months and probably close to a year before the novel, shortly before the Darth Maul comic, and it chronicles Maul's first solo assignment.  Written by James Luceno, the author of a duology set in the New Jedi Order series, as well as a forthcoming prequel-era novel, 'Cloak of Deception,' Luceno continues his high standards of writing and delivers a piece of quality entertainment.In this story, which in terms of length is worth approximately fifty printed pages, Darth Maul is sent to disrupt a couple of corporations mining lommite ore, a substance needed for the production of transparisteel.  With these corporations devastated, the Neimoidian Trade Federation will pick up the pieces, and the profits, helping to cement their trust in Darth Sidious.This story shows us a more restrained side of Maul than we have seen before.  In the comic, he was a killing machine, plain and simple.  In the novel, he was a ruthless hunter.  This story was able to show us his ability to be patient when necessary, to cover his tracks, to deceive rather than simply all-out attack.  Of course, there is a cool lightsaber fight, but the appeal of this story is in his other abilities.  In addition, in this book we meet Lieutenant Governor Tarkin of Eriadu.  Yes, the same Tarkin who later dies in the movie, and the same Tarkin who will be a main character in 'Cloak of Deception.'  I love the way Luceno is able to tie things together.Overall, this is a very fun story.  Is it worth two dollars?  Yes.  Unfortunately, without the ability to print the eBook format means staring at a computer screen for around an hour, which really detracted from the experience for me.  Nevertheless, if you like Star Wars, or are a 'Mauloholic,' this book is worth the buying.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worth every cent", "unixReviewTime": 982713600, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2001"}

Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced", "unixReviewTime": 1331769600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2012"}

Several other Jedi are introduced as the story moves along.At the end of the story our heroes are making a mad dash back to Coruscant to halt or at least influence an important Senate vote. This is not surprising. Throughout the New Jedi Order series so far the Senate and the New Republic leadership are constantly causing problems and making extremely questionable decisions.Mr. Denning has more Star Wars books coming down the road, so Recovery is well worth reading. It can give you an idea of his style and possibly a little better understanding of some of his Jedi characters.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Solos come together", "unixReviewTime": 1389398400, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2014"}

Disappointingly, Williams works in very little of the character development seen with Jacen in Traitor. Only once was Jacen's \"VongSense\" utilized during this story, and it nearly directly contradicted another scene earlier in the novella. Jaina also suddenly doesn't seem to use her \"Trickster Goddess\" repertoire anymore, which was a little disconcerting.Some of these seemingly minor discrepancies seemed a little troublesome while reading, and are probably the only drawbacks to the story. Timing may have a lot to do with it, however, as most of Destiny's Way had been written over a year ago, possibly before Traitor had gone through its final draft (publishing deadlines and schedules are strange sometimes). However, I will give the benefit of the doubt to Mr. Williams as--I believe--this story was written after Destiny's Way was completed, and is but a small part of the overall story. Being small in page count doesn't leave room for a lot of character development, I'm sure. The rest of the story easily makes up for the few minor problems, though.Mildly impressive was the overall length of Ylesia, which is most likely equivalent to about seventy-to-eighty written pages of text. The story flows well, and never really drags on. Verbiage was also quite good with no particular over-usage to any noticeable effect. Classifying it as outstanding fiction would be difficult, but calling it good writing is not. If this eBook is any indication, Destiny's Way should be worth the money for the events contained within, but not necessarily for an earth-shattering reading experience. One thing is for sure though: after blowing through Ylesia in an afternoon, Destiny's Way should be a fast, enjoyable read.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Ylesia", "unixReviewTime": 1343433600, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2012"}

The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.

{"reviewerID": "ABF9TML1GLCJ6", "asin": "B000FBFE50", "reviewerName": "Luca", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "George Bernard Shaw was the master intellectual of British socialism and has been one of the most influential political commentators of the twentieth century. \"Socialism and Superior Brains\" provides a comprehensive critical account of his political ideas. Shaw assumed many roles as a thinker, including those of artist-philosopher, clowning prophet, and pamphleteer. This book explains the methods he employed, the levels of abstraction at which his thought operated, and the intentions which informed his epic engagement with ideas. Part One provides an intellectual biography, while at the same time analyzing Shaw's concerns in relation to his Fabianism, arguments for equality of income, and ideas on democracy and education. Part Two looks at those areas which Shaw approached as long-standing historical problems or dramas requiring immediate thought or action: sexual equality, the Irish question, war, fascism and Sovietism. This book is directed to the general reader as well as the specialist. It will be central reading for anyone seeking to understand Shaw's life, his literary and political writings, or the development of political thinking in this century.The above paragraph delineates the book in accordance with the published outline. Yet there is much more to the book than may meet the eye from the perspective of an intelligent reader. It is in the crevices of the structure that Shaw refuses to edify wherein we find the energy of his thought, much as in his plays where the whimsical is but a cover for the depth of a psychological trance. Shaw's concept of individual anarchism and his countercultural descriptions of evolutionary righteousness put him beyond the order of most liberal thinkers, and daringly exploit and expound a theorem that goes beyond good and evil. But to allow for the inadmissible prescription of a utopian society, that in addition to being functional is also adherent to the stratas of individual aims is a project that requires more than simple aggregates of historical and political investigations, astute suppositions and penetrating assessments; it calls for a great deal of maturity which may readily be condensed into a symptom of naivet&eacute; by critics of every stamp or affiliation. It is not since William Morris that a thinker as dreamy as Shelley and as beaming with common sense as Thomas Paine forced his thought on the general public. His reputation as a playwright speaks in favor of his artistic virtues, but we have only controversial and insolent ridicule when we approach him as a bona fide political thinker. The issue here, perhaps, may be more than a matter of style, or truth: it may be buried in a heap of psychological habits we find too appealing to admit as appalling. If one were to take Shaw's claim that we should do away with punishment altogether, as in no prisons or a an incarnate legal superego, we will find few even remotely cordial to the propositions invested in his writings. Socialism is here defined as extreme for practical purposes, anarchism as absolute freedom and, finally life not as a dialectical struggle but borne of a freedom that we have denied ourselves by way of social hierarchical diagnostics and a concept of democracy Shaw judges as absurd and distressing - the art of deceit most effectively endowed with consent by those being deceived.Furthermore Griffith dilutes the presence of a social imperative that draws its impressions without the stigma of a political orientation. Words suchh as class struggle, economic equality are wielded with sensibility and a sense of historical authority, but the cynicism of classifications within a framework of proletarian or a bourgeoisie morality are radically forsworn. The essence of its political statement is assumed under the head of socialism and Fabianism, but the intent is not so much to educated, rather it is to uneducated a socius of assumed truths that demean, degrade and incarcerate. Foucault designates anthropology, by circumscriptions that uproot an archeology of knowledge that defines the individual in ways that make us feel strangers to ourselves, but Shaw's depth stood beyond the strata of discourse of his time and still does of ours. The philosophy of life, implicitly and explicitly, must yet be understood, and Gareth Griffith does an admirable work in trying to bring us closer to the core of its tenets. However it is safe to say that if we look upon the beauty of humanity as a utopian distillation then we realize why the use of words such as superman or ubermensch are greeted with disparaging tones and fearful cadences. In all truth the message here treated is too much for us and the author might as well have screamed his heart out in the desert because few, less than few, will peruse this book with that suspension of preconceived ideas which we must by necessity begin from and map out of. Garreth Griffith does more than just offer a delighful read, this study is more than merely a source whereby the acquisition of knowledge of a major playwright may be had; There is the candor of innocence, the wisp of absence, the insistant breakdown of our compromising tendencies, and in doing so challenges its audience to truly listen to its content, as if the echo of its voice where to travel beyond the borders of space lost in an abyss of skepticism. this is the best secondary literature on the subject and an indispensable guide to 20th century political thought. But it is a work of postmodern sensibility, which reluctantly deciphers the chaos from the carnival. In its explication the book does nothing less tha expound the heart of postmodern ethics. Beckett and Shaw are far more similar than we may at first realize. They are two sides of the same coin: from head to tail one choice to make: coin.

Still, Ladyman covers the basics and then some using a clear style that engages the reader, bringing her gradually closer to some deep questions about the nature of science. The book starts with the standard topics of induction (and the corresponding problem pointed out by David Hume), moving to Popper's falsificationism, originally proposed as a solution to the problem of justification of inductive inference. After having explained why falsificationism in turn didn't work very well, Ladyman proceeds to Kuhn and the idea of paradigm shifts in the history of science. The difficult part comes in the second section, which is entirely devoted to the still ongoing debate between realists and antirealists in science. The reader is slowly but surely walked through increasingly complex rebuttals and counter-rebuttals articulated by major players in this high-level intellectual dispute, encountering fundamental concepts in modern philosophy of science throughout the ride. We learn about the underdetermination of theories by data, inference to the best explanation, constructive empiricism, the Duhem-Quine thesis and theories of explanation. The reader never gets to a final answer, which of course is not the point, but with a bit of effort it should be possible to follow Ladyman all the way to the end. The last two short sections, on idealisation and structural realism, are a bit too short to be effective; they should be either cut out or expanded in future editions. Still, I'm planning to use this book next semester in a 300-level class on philosophy of science, and I'm looking forward to the puzzled reactions of my students when they'll begin to appreciate how little we understand about how science works.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Realism vs. Antirealism", "unixReviewTime": 1257379200, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2009"}

There are various ways to approach the king lists for this period, and Yorke is somewhat of a minimalist, preferring not to list rulers who cannot be attested by relatively reliable sources (and for early Anglo-Saxon England, \"relatively reliable\" is itself a relative term), so her lists do not include some rulers mentioned in that reliable old stand-by, the \"Handbook of British Chronology.\"  She also includes useful notes on what little is known about some of the less-known groups which may have been sub-kingdoms with brief flashes of autonomy, like Lindsey, Wight, the Hwicce, Middle Angles and Maegonsaeten, and Elmet.Most interesting to me was her careful reconstruction of the political trajectory of Kent, suggesting that instead of being a single state, it may have been for much of its history divided into two kingdoms, East Kent and West Kent, the latter at times including Sussex, and that many of the kings listed. whose chronology has been so debateable, may in fact have ruled concurrently in its two halves.This is a useful addition to the library of anyone interested in Anglo-Saxon England or the \"Dark Ages,\" and a nice guide to the period that fascinated J.R.R.

Mueller \"Lachmanniac\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "This carefully written book on the informational role of prices does two things.  First of all, it attempts to review critically the contributions of Grossman, Stiglitz, Simon, and Nelson on the \"informational efficiency\" of market prices.  Secondly, the author presents the Austrian (Kirznerian, really) theory of market prices.  The author concludes that other theories of market prices are really leaving something essential out, namely, the disequilibrium character of market prices.  It is not correct to theorize about the informational role of market prices from an equilibrium standpoint because it is clear that prices serve to coordinate economic activity.  Therefore, given that knowledge by individuals is not perfect, a study of the economic system (and of prices) should be concerned with solving this \"knowledge problem.\"  Additionally, an economic theory of equilibrium is unable to explain the informational role prices perform because in equilibrium the information problem has already been solved.  From this starting point, the author then launches into the \"Austrian\" theory of market disequilibrium (covered in chapter 2).  Central to this theory is the idea that entrepreneurs act to discover profitable opportunities that have previously gone unnoticed.  Entrepreneurial action corrects market errors while never actually reaching equilibrium.  Unfortunately, the author does not go into great detail about why the economy cannot reach equilibrium through successful entrepreneurship. (The typical Austrian explanation is that the \"data\" are always changing.)In chapter 3 the author expounds the challenged to this theory raised by Grossman and Stiglitz.  Very briefly, the author argues that Grossman and Stiglitz do not understand the Austrian theory of the market process.  Grossman and Stiglitz raised the objection that the informational role of prices is \"of interest\" only when information is costly.  But when information is costly, it does not follow that prices are \"informationally efficient.\"  This is because as soon as *some* individuals incur the costs of searching for information that eventually affects the vector of prices, other individuals can essentially free-ride on this information without ever shouldering these costs.  This will lead to an underproduction in the search for information because of the problem of externalities associated with market prices.  The author raises some interesting objections to this thesis.  Very briefly, Grossman and Stiglitz are ignoring the importance of ignorance and time in their analysis.  Individuals are not only \"optimally ignorant\", but also suffer from \"sheer ignorance\".  The \"economics of information\", to which Grossman and Stiglitz have contributed, only consider the first case.  Also, time is real.  It is possible for individuals to profit from their information before prices adjust.For Herbert Simon, the idea is that because people's cognitive capacities are limited, their ability to process complex information is also limited.  However, an important implication of this theory is that there is no \"knowledge problem\" in a simple world.  For Simon, the assumption of human omniscience or optimizing action is inappropriate because the real world is complicated and complex.  However, in a simple, primitive, and barter-type world, there no longer are limitations to man's computation powers.  For the author, however, the knowledge problem exists even in primitive societies.  The only solution to economic problems is entrepreneurial discovery, and this exists in both complex and simple economies.  In short, the problem is not that individuals face \"too many facts\", but that they remain \"unaware of them.\"  This is where entrepreneurial discovery comes in.  Prices signal to entrepreneurs profitable opportunties that can be discovered only through continued alertness.Finally, for Nelson the idea is that markets respond \"quickly\" to prices while government responds \"qualitatively\" to price changes.  This presentation, according to Nelson, makes the superiority of markets questionable.  For Nelson, it is not the speed of adjustment that is important, but the quality of response that is of paramount interest.  Again, the author uses the same argument to refute Nelson's efforts.  The problem does not concern the speed and quality of response, but really the \"discovery\" of the relevant facts.  The facts must first be discovered before they can be acted upon, and for the author only markets that provide profit opportunties to altert entrepreneurs can do this.Now the author's treatment of the theories of these authors is really great.  I learned a lot about these theories from reading this book.  But I subtracted one star in my review because the author does not apply the same critical scrutiny to his own theory (the Austrian theory of entrepreneurship).  He just takes it for granted that prices stimulate entrpreneurial discovery because people are motivated by profits.  But there are some problems with this theory.1.)  First of all, the author argues on page 18 that the only thing distinguishing Austrian entrepreneurship from economic maximation is the \"act of perception.\"  Once perception occurs, according to the author, the agent them optimizes.  Therefore, once perception transforms into action (which must happen for Austrian entrepreneurship to coordinate economic activity), the two approaches (Misesian and Robbinsian) become identical.  Now all Austrians will object to this, but this is how the author presents his theory of entrpreneurship (see pages 18 and 55).2.) The author also correctly notes that action is not instantaneous.  Therfore, entrepreneurial discovery does not refer to \"current prices\", but to \"expected prices\" (page 19).  WOW!  Once you talk about expectations, it makes no sense to speak of \"discovery\" because the successful discovery of \"current\" conditions depends entirely upon the anticipation of future prices.  It follows from this then that all acts of entrepreneurial discovery are inescapably speculative.  Entpreneurial error (i.e. the failure to perceive opportunities) becomes meaningless since success and failure now depend on implementation and not discovery.  You can no longer \"test\" the success of entrepreneurial action *ex ante*. (see also pages 59-60).3.)  This objection also follows from the previous one.  Some economists (Jack High, for example) have argued that it does not make sense to speak of entpreneurship as coordinating because entrepreneurial action often disrupts activities that were previously taking place.  The author addresses this point (page 91) and responds by saying that entrpreneurship acts to remove ignorance and that no additional ignorance is caused by entrepreneurship.  But the author makes the same mistake he accuses everyone else of.  The collation of different variants (degrees) of ignorance presumes complete knowledge.  This is not the case.  Entrpreneurship does disrupt existing plans.  This is true.  But it does not follow that it DOES NOT add additional ignorance to the system.4.)  One final point I would like to make to clear up a lot of confusion.  Contemporary Austrians (Pete Boettke, Steven Horwitz, etc. etc.) speak of prices as \"knowledge surrogates\", no doubt borrowing this term from this book.  They see prices as knowledge surrogates.  But this is not the Austrian view.  Prices are NOT summaries or surrogates of information (knowledge).  The author makes this clear.  Here is the author:  \"Kirzner's emphasis is more on the discovery of knowledge than on its summarization or its transmission\" (page 45).  Contemporary Austrians are making a mistake by speaking of disequilibrium prices as \"knowledge surrogates.\"  It is surprising that Austrians have made this mistake because the author repeatedly stresses this distinction.  In fact, the inclusion of the chapter on Herbert Simon was meant to distinguish these two views.  Here is the author again on Simon: \"The difference appears to stem from the dissimilar views held of ignorance and discovery, and from the difference between interpreting prices as only 'information-saving' devices and interpreting them as part of an entrpreneurial discovery procedure.\"  For Simon, prices work for individuals because they are a simplifying device for a complex world.  Individuals, according to Simon, can infer market conditions from prices wihtout having to know all the details of every event.  Contemporary Austrians have argued the same thing.  But this is not the author's view.  The author stresses the \"discovery\" role of prices, and NOT its \"information-saving\" role.  Austrians should correct this mistake when they present their theories to students.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Austrian take on Prices....", "unixReviewTime": 1216080000, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2008"}

Verrian is captured on the field of battle. She's brought before Kendarra, Queen of Asperia, naked in chains, and learns that her fate is to remain naked and in chains, the personal slave of Kendarra, and by personal we mean she'll spend much of her time naked with her face in Kendarra's lap.It will take much torment to transform General Jendri into a servile sex slave, but the Queen is down with that. Fortunately, the punishment consists of whipping and paddling, mostly, and other than a couple of scenes, it's not dwelt upon -- no heavy BDSM here. Another reason I liked this book.The Punishing of Jendri definitely falls on the porny end of the erotic romance spectrum. The sex scenes are explicit and lengthy, and there are a LOT of them. The major drawback in fact is that oral sex is about the only sex act they perform, which gets repetitive.Fortunately, there is also a lot of tasty slavegirl dominance and submission in the story. Jendri is renamed Riki the slut, and is forced to go naked at all times, including when the queen is holding an audience. Riki the slut is also forced to perform orally while naked. In public. What's worse, she's physically attracted to the queen, and her body often \"betrays\" her as she gives her queen the lip and tongue service she requires.Despite the physical attraction, there's no love lost between Kendarra and Jendri. Jendri does as the queen orders but only out of fear of punishment, a well-founded fear, as the queen punishes her for the least little thing. The story element of the book lies in how Kendarra and Jendri's relationship changes, for the better overall. I won't give away plot points on that but I will say that the change in the relationship is handled well. It's not a John Normanish, \"I will never be a slave ... oh, I LOVE being a slave\" sort of thing at all. There's a good reason why the relationship changes, and the changes are shown as occurring incrementally, over time.That said, I do wish the psychological element of Jendri's transformation from a proud general to a lowly sex  slave had been dwelt on at more length. Also, the book was way short on bondage for my tastes. No gag scenes, and Jendri is tied to tables and posts and so forth when she's whipped and paddled, but that's about it. Very little sexual bondage, sadly.If you like slavegirl dominance and submission with lots and lots and lots of cunnilingus, especially in a medieval lesbian fantasy world, get your money out now, this book is for you!  Even those who, like me, mostly enjoy the slavegirl sex with dominance and submission scenes, will enjoy the book.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lots of lesbian dominance and submission here", "unixReviewTime": 1371772800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2013"}

From the works of Tolkein on up to Terry Pratchett, we have series of three, five, twenty or even thirty-six books. You don't generally see that in other genres. Oh, there's the occasional exception, but if you want really large, epic works, fantasy is your go-to genre.I'm not sure why this is. I guess it's because authors love to have a chance to show off and what better way to show off then by creating an entire world from scratch? Creating people, places and things that don't, and never have, existed. I've done it myself and it is a lot of fun!\"A Song of Ice and Fire\", the so-far five book series by famed author George R R Martin is a perfect example of this. He's created a world broadly based on England during the War of the Roses. Within this world he's created his own culture, made up his own religions and really created a setting that, while familiar, is still fairly different. If nothing else, there's hardly any magic, which may make it especially unique in the field of fantasy.This two-book set is a great way to get into this world. You get the first two books, \"A Game of Thrones\" and \"A Clash of Kings\", which will give you enough reading material and characters to leave your head spinning for a week.The plot concerns a war of succession that's waged after the King dies. There's several competing heads that want the crown, and, again, almost astonishingly for fantasy, none of them are possessed by Dark Forces (tm),or in thrall to Evil Powers (tm). Instead they're just motivated by desires for things like power, which makes them quite a bit more realistic than characters in most fantasy works who tend to be evil for the sake of evil or possessed by the afforementioned Dark Forces (\"Eragon\", the Lord of the Rings, the Videssos series, most of Valdemar, Narnia, etc).So if you want a series where good and evil are clearly established and you get a paint-by-numbers plotline, look to those books.

I have read the series (published to date... there is more coming) 2 times, and this second time I downloaded it to my Kindle (a fantastic device... also highly recommended!!!).  The series is set in a medieval type world, with elements of magic (dragons and what appear to be evil wraith-like creatures of the far north).  The story revolves around several factions that are vying for control of a kingdom composed of a collection of very strong noble houses.  To date, there are hints of a greater threat from outside the fractious nobility of the kingdom, but the details of that threat will have to wait for future installments in the series.  There are lots of characters, and the author changes the viewpoint from one to the next as the series unfolds.  It starts as a tale of good vs evil, but as the perspective changes from one character to another, the shades of gray multiply!  The character development is very good, and while I look forward to updates on other characters and the books unfold, I am captivated that the story of the character that is unfolding as I read.This is a great book, and the start of a great series.  It is fantasy, but targeted at adults to a greater degree than a lot of this genre.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  If I were to compare it to other series, I would most closely compare it to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  And the Wheel of Time pales in comparison.  Martin's writing is more concise, with none of the redundancies of Jordan.  Story lines and plot lines, character development, as well as thematic elements are much more \"grown up\" than with Jordan.  Martin's world building is superb, and with each character you feel yourself \"becoming\" that character.  The only drawback to this series is the length of time between new installments.  It has been a looooonnnnnggggg time since the last published book (A Feast for Crows), and although the next installment (A Dance with Dragons) is due this fall... it has been promised in the fall for the past 2 years!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic series!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1247961600, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2009"}

I seriously wonder if George Martin will ever finish the books. Besides, my memory is not that good and with long gaps between versions I will need to re-read the books (or find a reader's digest version somewhere).However, my major complaint with the kindle version is that I like to look at the maps, and the maps have been scanned in at a VERY tiny size such that they are completely useless!!! I read the book in paperback first, and was constantly referring back to the map to try to understand the geography of the world George Martin has created.

Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue.

I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book \"A Forest Apart\" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid \"IT\" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a \"distraction.\"  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.

Simons \"at diversophy.com\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "&#8220;Lite&#8221; in food advertisements means less filling, less cloying, easier, more refreshing, less calories, and in most cases less nourishment. The concept is now being applied to other areas of life where overload is likely, as for example, the need for useful cultural information in a global and mobile world.In the Know in Mexico & Central America is a good example of this trend to hand over only the essentials in an easily digestible form. It is clearly pitched to a US American audience, and its greatest strength is the clear, lucid and fresh language with which it gives an overview of the basic issues of culture, individual and family expatriation, managing in a new environment and learning to navigate local business behavior. With the growing number of ESL speakers, such writing is increasingly important.More than a third of Phillips&#8217; book is dedicated to background of the region it addresses. Geographic, historical, demographic, social and political information is organized by country. This is bare bones data that does not provide a good read, but succinctly presents the country of one&#8217;s interest. Since much of the history of countries in this region is common and intertwined, there is considerable repetition here. One wonders whether presenting the information from a regional point of view first might both lighten the text and provide better perspective for the end user.In the middle section of the book, the boilerplate of culture general theory is presented and applied to expatriation in a jargon-free, personal and breezy US style. This is useful basic information about coping with transition. It does not purport to provide detail or insight into the values, behaviors and receiving culture that would help us to learn to value it on its own terms. At least 90% of this material could have been written for US Americans going abroad to almost any destination outside Canada and Northern Europe.The last 40 pages provide the text of language training found on the CD and practical appendices containing contacts and resources as well as metric equivalents and the like.This book and CD are like training wheels on a child&#8217;s first bicycle. They provides the totally uninitiated with enough short-term linguistic and cultural awareness to avoid an immediate crash. But the real task of learning to balance and ride the streets of a new culture still remains. At best the book steers the rider toward desiring and acquiring this skill; at worst it instills false confidence. Today when the traditional colonial model of expatriate privilege and handholding is caving in due to the sheer mobility generated by the global economy, do-it-yourself expatriates and business travelers need someplace like this to start, but also need to know that there is lots more to learn.Like many US publications, In the Know in Mexico & Central America is illustrated with a whimsical cartoons that the US reader will probably enjoy and identify with. Unfortunately, at least some of the illustration space could have been better used. The absence of a map of the region is startling, given the generally acknowledged US ignorance of geography. Using a paragraph to describe the flags of each nation, when a small cut would do, seems strangely anachronistic in an visual Internet age.It is unfair to fault a book for what it is not, but we wonder more about the role of the print medium to do what online materials can now much better deliver. For example, nothing that we could see tells the potential purchaser or user that the CD is audio rather than data&#8212;the reviewer shoved it into his computer by instinct, not his Walkman. Given the capacity of the CD medium, one imagines it could have been used better to support the cultural as well as the linguistic content.Is there value for money here?

Having arisen as a deceptively small and to all appearances harmless bidpedal ancestor of the earliest pro-simian species, Man evolved into a violent and powerful predator who was master of his planet. Technological advancements allowed Man to travel to the stars colonizing a million planets and enslaving or eliminating all those he met who posed any threat, real or imagined. Notwithstanding his powerful position astride the top of the galactic food chain, as it were, mankind has slipped into extinction. Five millennia after the last known representative of our species died, an alien planet has sent a scientific archeological team to earth to study man's rise and fall by a careful examination of the artifacts they find in the location now known as the birthplace of our species - Olduvai Gorge.\"Seven Views of Olduvai Gorge\" is a series of seven short stories commenting on man's violent and aggressive nature ranging in time from our earliest pre-history as a species that could hardly be graced even with the term \"caveman\" to a hypothesized galactic superpower with technological skills that included interstellar travel and domination of a million other planets. The stories are all told by \"He Who Sees\", a member of the alien archeological team who has the uncanny ability to see, hear, feel and completely experience the history of an artifact by subsuming it into his own body and absorbing its history into his mentality.This collection of stories, which won the 1994 Nebula Award for best novella, portray a bleak, dismal and disappointed view of an aggressive, violent and self-centered humanity. Perhaps the most disappointing thing of all about this fine book is that, as a reader of the book and a member of the race under discussion, I can find no reason to dispute Michael Resnick's hard-hearted view of our history.It would be most unfair to disclose the point of the final story to a potential reader. But, suffice it to say, although Michael Resnick's cynicism remains obvious at the close of his novel, it is just possible - barely - that we could make something of ourselves if we had another chance.\"Seven Views of Olduvai Gorge\" is short, sweet and compellingly powerful.

Chekhov was a brilliant genius of classic short stories and plays. In this Modern Library edition his four most famous plays are translated into English.Those plays are:1. The Seagull: This 1896  play won fame for Chekhov following its production at the Moscow Art Theatre. The work deals with the love of the fledgling playwright Trepilov in love with Nina who dreams of becoming a great actress. Nina falls in love with the famous playwright Trigorin running away with him. In despair, Trepilov plays a dead seagull which he has shot down at the feet of Nina. Two years later, Nina returns to the estate deserted by her quondom lover the scamp Trigorin. She declares that her life has been shot down just as the seagull was earlier brought down to death. Trigorin attempts suicide for the second time and is successful in this effort. The play is beautifully written and the theme of being busy with work is prominent. It is a play about the hard work necessary by a playwright as well as dealing with a tragic love story.2. Uncle Vanya-This 1899 play deals with the kindly Uncle Vanya who has managed the estate of professor Serebryakov for many years. Vanya comes to realize that the lazy professor is an academic fraud. Vanya falls in love with the professor's lovely second wife Elena Andreyevna. She rejects him as a lover. The inept Vanya then attempts to kill the professor with a gun but fails. The professor forgives him though he agrees not to sell the estate which Vanya feared would occur. Life returns to normal.3. The Three Sisters-The play deals with the boring lives of three sisters from Moscow: Olga, Masha and Irina who live in a provincial city of 100,000. The three women dream of returning to Moscow; fall in love with various officers stationed in the town but at the end of Act IV remain in their dull lives. The play deals with ordinary day to day existence. The lives of the characters are jejune as they yearn to be free of everyday responsibilities. They remind this reviewer of Thoreau's famous line about people living lives of \"quiet desperation.\"4. The Cherry Orchard deals with the forced sale of a beautiful Cherry Orchard by an aristocratic family experiencing hard economic times. The plangent sound of an ax cutting down the cherry trees ends the play.All of these plays were written in four acts. Their major themes are the need for work even in a world where such effort might seem futile.Chekhov's focus is on families of the lower aristocracy and middle class.

Or the ultimate, a ride on the Crazy Ships.No real main protagonist. Several characters are followed and this done well. Easy to stay interested in several characters. The brother sister storyline is not that provocative at all. I was afraid a had a smut book for a bit. Genetics play a role in the story. Self aware AI is prohibited and controled by an inhibitor chip in computers. Herc could have had a more expanded role.We achieve FTL spaceflight by attaching two identical masses and at activation of the drive one mass goes to the destination and the other to the unknown. The problem is a 50 percent failure rate. Hard on the nerves and a wicked Corp punishment for those that need to be eliminated. Sentence them to 3 to 5 jumps and the odds will provide.Income inequality, graft and corruption, and the lack of justice (warning signs now) are straining the Corp society as the tale begins. My first book by DB. A nice read and I will check out more. His other titles look provocative and I wonder how close to the edge? This one was not mild and not disgusting either. Some other scifi I've read was much more adult for lack of a better word and not always good. Thanks DB.

Weaver", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "It's good to remember the subtitle of \"Zero Hour\" while reading the novel: \"A Novel of Adventure in China in the early days of WWII.\" It is an \"adventure,\" not a \"historical novel.\" The emphasis is on action, fast and furious. The plot is pretty tight, actually, and moves along with few distractions. There is a major plot shift in the middle of the book, making it read almost like 2 back-to-back short stories rather than 1 coherent whole. The author has a light touch with his prose. There is no sexual content, which I found refreshing, only mild cursing in character dialogue, and violence is described in far from forensic detail. In that respect, the book's tone reminds me of old serials shown before the main feature. Doc Savage would be right at home with Ruber's characters.What you will not find: character development, detailed descriptions of weapons and equipment, or a deep understanding of the complex and puzzling world of China in the 1930s. The protagonist is a true pulp hero: supremely confident and competent at every step of the plot. He can fix anything and always shoots straight. In fact, he shows little or no moral conflict over the sabotage his squad executes, or the civilian casualties he knows will result as respisals. The enemies are stock characters: angry, bored, incompetent, vain, etc, with little development to make them more than cardboard targets. (But at the same time, they're not badly racially sterotyped, so I'll give the author points there.) There is no doubt who the reader should be rooting for. Equipment is disappointingly described, if not downright anachronistic. Ruber doesn't describe anything in depth that doesn't fire a .45 cartridge. He mentions Japanese personnel carriers often. Now there was one model of Japanese personnel carrier (the HO-HA), however, it was very rare. China was not a theater where the IJA engaged much armor, so I really doubt the presence of armor and rare personnel carriers in the numbers he portrays. Worse, he frequently mentions Japanese helicopters. Now there was a Japanese autogyro (which would have been a better term for the craft in the novel) which was used for artillery spotting during WWII. It made its first flight in May, 1941: 2 years after the events of the novel. Finally, China is little more than terrain to be driven over. There is no interaction with the population, or description or landscape. It could as well be the hills outside Burbank for his purposes. Now that I think of it, the novel feels a bit like reading a video game walkthrough. I don't mean to sound overly negative. The book was cheap; I did finish it, and did enjoy it. However, remembering that it's an \"adventure\" kept me from wanting it to deliver more than it was going to.

I mean the plot and concept had promise, but the execution was so flawed.  Aaron Rosenberg isn't on the up and up of anything technical it seems.He makes several obvious mistakes that made me NOT want to finish reading the book.  Though I eventually did finish Book 1 and still slowly going through (or rather forcing myself) to finish Book 2, mainly because I am a big fan of the SCE series and I don't want to miss any character developments that might happen in this flawed book that might be referenced in books after this one.Firstly the author invents a mystery ship that is powered by absorbed solar/stellar energies.  This ship ends up in a system with a semi-unstable star and a hidden federation outpost.  The ship detects the hidden outpost and the crew had to commit suicide because get this: the somewhat unstable star somehow caused the mystery ship to absorb more energy than it can handle and had to \"vent\" the energy.  It vents the energy internally because venting it externally supposedly would cause the system's star to go Nova.  Uh...like...duh!  I don't care how much energy a ship can absorb from a star...whatever amount it is is not enough to make a star go Nova when \"vented\".  That energy came from the star in question to begin with...and it wasn't enough to make the star go Nova when the star was outputting it!2nd \"duh\" mistake: Gomez's predecessor Salek, had to sacrifice himself for no sane reason that the author can explain properly.  Basically Cardassians detect the mystery ship and head to intercept it and the da Vinci.  Salek ends up controlling the mystery ship's energy venting thing as weapon.  He did this by reprogramming the ship to perform the venting action...internally.  Then he controls the da Vinci's transporters to beam whatever energy was vented internally to the Cardassian ship to destroy it.  Salek perishes during the internal venting of energy.  This does not compute!  If the vented energy is powerful enough to destroy the Cardassian ship (which was way bigger than the da Vinci), how the heck can the da Vinci possibly hold all that energy in its transporter buffers without totally overloading their transporters?! Also if Salek was able to reprogram the mystery ship's systems to do what he wanted to do...why the heck did he have to stay INSIDE that ship while it did its thing?  Why not beam back to the da Vinci?  Why throw away his life when it was not necessary?  Does not makes sense right?  The author never explains why Salek had to be PHYSICALLY present inside that ship for it to do what he wanted it to do.  You will go insane when you read this book.  The author is extremely very technically-challenged.And I'm only a few chapters inside Book 2...but that one seems even more flawed than the first.  In the first book, when the da Vinci crew first boards it...they notice charred remains of its crew (charred...but intact).  Then in book 2, the author claims the crew of this ship was \"vaporized\".  Big difference between charred remains of the crew and \"VAPORIZED\"!And the worst technical error so far: it is well established in Star Trek canon that going to Warp in a gravity causes major problems for the ship (if not the source of the gravity well too).  However our technically-challenged author has the mystery ship circling a SUPERNOVA at ABOVE WARP 1, then using that to SLINGSHOT itself to WARP NINE!  Uh...gravity well (massive gravity well in this case) and warp speed DO NOT MIX!  And Warp 1 to Warp 9 using the \"slingshot effect\" is just extremely impossible that your brain hurts just trying to figure out how this author could have even come up with this.  Has he never read or watched other Star Trek shows or books before writing this book?Perhaps I am being too nitpicky here.  But this is an SCE book.  Technology and Engineering matters feature front and center in this book.  So whoever writes SCE books should at least get the basic Star Trek TECH STUFF RIGHT!  Warp 1 to Warp 9 via a slingshot effect! c'mon!Unless you are a big fan of the SCE series, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK...it will give you headaches!  I'm only forcing myself to read it because SCE books tend to refer to past books for something or other and I don't want to find myself reading a book written after this one referring to something that happend in this flawed flawed book, and me not knowing what the reference was about", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Worst SCE Book I Have Read!", "unixReviewTime": 1224806400, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2008"}

And not to discourage sales of this fine book, but I would also recommend that you steer clear of making a purchase as well.John Douglas makes no bones about the fact that he has no problems with guns or capital punishment.  And if you are an UNSUB -- the F.B.I.s acronym for \"unknown subject,\" and one that Mr. Douglas uses often throughout -- but later are convicted, he doesn't have much time worrying about cruel and unusual punishment for you either.  He even discusses this at the end of a chapter, comparing the needs of a serial killer versus the needs of the victims' families.  Guess which one is more important to Mr. Douglas?And I really appreciated this perspective myself, since authors often times play both sides of an argument to not offend anyone, and therefore try to squeak out a few more sales.  That doesn't work well with me, and Mr. Douglas does not make that rookie mistake.  One thing that I remember from my early days in school from the best teachers:  \"Pick a side of an argument and argue it!\"  Most Americans nowadays don't know how to argue because at least they aren't willing to choose a side.  And forget about all of the logical fallacies that usually go along with it.But Mr. Douglas does do a fine job of arguing throughout this book.  While he might give multiple sides of an argument, he will then finally argue which side is the \"correct\" one with strong evidence as for why.  Nothing wrong with that.  As a matter of fact, it is a good tactic if you are going to enter into debate:  address your competition's points and attack them before he has a chance to speak.  It gives you the upper hand.I don't think that it could easily be argued, however, that Mr. Douglas is the greatest writer in the world.  I read a book from Dr. Robert Keppel -- a police officer, detective, and retired professor in Seattle -- and his writing style was surely better.  But these two guys are at least strong acquaintances; Mr. Douglass alludes to that point at least once in the book.  And there is a passage in one of the chapters where Mr. Douglas is discussing Dr. Keppel and another gentleman named \"Robert\" or \"Bob\" and the author seemed to use both names interchangeably, so I was lost figuring out which \"Bob\" or \"Robert\" that the passage was discussing.  And I even read a couple of pages twice and I was still confused.But it's not the case that Mr. Douglas is a bad writer, far from it; you could just say that it is not his number one forte.  That is fine and understood.  He surely is one of the greatest profilers ever, and I \"enjoyed\" -- if \"enjoyed\" is the correct word -- reading about many of the cases that he worked on in which I'm already aware.  I have read so many true crime books now that, as a matter of fact, it was unusual if he discussed a case in which I wasn't already familiar.I think that the strongest point of this work:  Mr. Douglas does not talk down to his readers.  Even though it's probably not true, he is nice enough to the reader to at least make you believe you could become a profiler yourself given enough time and education.  After all, he has many \"disciples\" that he has trained himself, and that might be his greatest legacy.  (As a side note, and a possible theme of the book:  he discusses the Manson murders at one point, of course.  Mr. Douglas even called Manson's followers \"disciples,\" and it got me thinking:  Mr. Manson and Mr. Douglas have some similarities, but Mr. Douglas used his strengths for good while Mr. Manson used his strengths for evil.)And so I will leave you with some advice if you are considering reading this fine book.  I would \"bone up\" on as many cases as you possibly can first; it will help you when reading this book I believe.  And if you are at that point -- and are a conservative as well -- I highly recommend making that purchase and be ready for an inside look at how the F.B.I. really works.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Read -- for Half the Population", "unixReviewTime": 1375401600, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2013"}

In EVERY Star Trek book there's someone who \"envies that android calmness.\" I'm tired of hearing about it. Picard is often made to sound like a weasel, completely lacking any self-confidence and making the weirdest observations (\"Picard would give anything to learn how [those alien shields] worked\" and \"Picard sat back in his chair, studying the alien ship, letting his people have a few seconds to get ready\"). Is this the most highly decorated captain in Starfleet, who defeated the Borg almost single-handedly and told his Cardassian torturers to piss off? Bah!The dialogue is also terribly stilted and completely unrealistic for a TNG crew. Picard: \"I'm open to suggestions here, people\" or \"Give me targets, people!\" WTF is he, a public employee? or perhaps Kirk? 'Cause that's the way Kirk would address his officers; not Picard. Smith is also apparently unaware of proper operations on a Galaxy-class starship. When the Enterprise (still in the first two pages) needs to maneuver closer to the alien ship, Picard orders Data to take the helm. Was the conn officer not even there? Was s/he not good enough? What sense does it make to order your OPS officer to \"take the helm\"?As I said, the novella itself isn't bad plot-wise, and it does set up the rest of the series nicely... but if THIS is the standard of writing of some Star Trek novels, then even I have a shot at being published!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Made me feel better about my own writing!", "unixReviewTime": 1247443200, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2009"}

As is usual with a Dean Wesley Smith title, the plot and the writing were both well thought out and paced perfectly.One thing that I and most likely most every other Star Trek reader has become accustomed to and find highly enjoyable is the manner in which a new series is launched, with having familiar characters leading the way.  The Star Trek Starfleet Corps of Engineers series is no different, having Scotty and Geordi LaForge engrained in the story.  Also of great interest is the plethora of characters that will be, from what I gather, the main cast of characters for SCE, most of which were gleaned from the various series and their respective guest roles.The cover art for this e-book is fairly decent, giving the readers a good deal of information as to who and what they can expect within the pages and I especially like that they put the image of a Saber class starship on the cover, giving the readers the best information possible about the Da Vinci.The premise:Captain Picard and the crew of Enterprise find themselves in a protracted battle with a behemoth of a ship which had been attacking a colony.  After a considerable amount of time and effort, they defeat the &quot;beast&quot; and call in the Starfleet Corps of Engineers to survey the ship.  As luck would have it, Captain Picard soon finds that Captain Montgomery Scott is in charge of the SCE and is sending the Da Vinci to their position.Geordi decides that he'd like to stay with the SCE team and the survey and soon finds that Sonya Gomez is now Commander Sonya Gomez and that she'll be leading the survey missions.  What follows from there is a highly intriguing first tale in the Star Trek SCE series that harkens the reader back to the movie Aliens.I highly recommend this first novel in the Star Trek SCE series and can only hope that the stories that followed this one will match it in its quality.  {ssintrepid}", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "STSCE #1 The Belly of the Beast - A great lead off story!", "unixReviewTime": 1069286400, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2003"}

A plague is rapidly killing them and the only cure is grown on the planet Canara in Federation space. Fearing that the Federation would use the knowledge to destroy the Empire, the Romulans attempt to take the antidote by force rather than ask for help. However, the Canarans are fiercely loyal to the Federation and strongly oppose the Romulans. While they cannot hope to resist by force of arms, the Canarans set destructive charges that will destroy all of the material that can be used to make the antidote to the plague.As the story unfolds, we learn a great deal about the Romulan political system, the Praetor is the highest political figure and the position is currently being held by a greedy, self-serving individual. He sends one of the most loyal and effective Romulan commanders on what is a suicide mission into Federation space and also calls back into service an aged commander whose loyalty to the Empire is greater than any personal animosity he has for the Praetor and his political machinations.There are two subplots that complicate the situation. The first is that the computers on the Enterprise recently underwent maintenance and the technicians decided that they needed more of a personality. Therefore, they programmed the main computer to have a personality, including emotions. The computer falls in love with Kirk and considers him the only person in the universe. It ignores all other members of the crew, so nothing works for anyone else. The crew is largely helpless to do anything about the situation, which is supposed to be amusing. I didn't find it amusing at all, and thought that this subplot was too much of a distraction to the real story. A simple reboot using core memory should have solved the problem.The second subplot involved Admiral Iota, who hates the Romulans so bad that he barricades himself into auxiliary control on one of the Federation ships and fires on the Romulans. Once again, the crew of the ship is helpless to stop him. This is absurd; no Starfleet vessel would be constructed without some way to disable the weapons outside of auxiliary control. Furthermore, the idea that one man could barricade himself into an area and control the entire ship was one I found ridiculous.The two subplots spoiled the story for me.

Apparently something is very wrong in Romulan Space. They seem to know; but the reader is left in the dark for well over half the novel. The Federation seems to realize that *something* is amiss as well--but what? Invasion? That is their guess and their primary concern; and they do have one heck of a hawkish Commodore who is bent on a pre-emptive strike if necessary because he is convinced they'll never find out until it's too late. More on him later.Better heads prevail and one of the admirals sends Kirk and the Enterprise out toward the Neutral Zone to see if they can find out what's awry. They find a Romulan ship (actually the one the opening of the story has already introduced us to)-- in Federation space--itching for a fight if that's what it takes. Reading this one brought to mind the episode \"Balance of Terror\", and once again a very able Romulan commander is pitted against the wily Captain Kirk. This time however--after a predictably similar outcome of a lengthy combat, the Commander actually surrenders and submits to be taken captive aboard the Enterprise--it is here when they find out what has the Romulans in such a tizzy.I won't take it any further because that would divulge so much information it would make the first half of the novel entirely anticlimactic. That said, the story is extremely interesting, and one gets very wrapped up into what will be the fate of both the Enterprise (which eventually is surrounded by a fleet of Romulan ships--not to mention taken over by the renegade hawkish commodore in auxiliary control), and this Romulan commander that you come grant a degree of respect and even admiration. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is found in the title--some parts simply drag on a little bit longer than is necessary; and I do wish we'd have seen something not so nice happen to the Praetor who is a real stinker,--but not enough to make the novel anything but a keeper for a real Star Trek fan--just enough to make it a 4-star keeper!

It is truly a self-help/self-improvement book in that Dr. Weinberg doesn't tell the reader what to do or give formulas (there's no overly simplistic \"if he does this, you do this\", or \"if he says this, you must say this\"). Unlike other books in this genre that pigeon-hold men and are overly simplistic, Dr. Weinberg is respectful and insightful (no male-bashing here). I found it refreshing how the author stresses the importance of balancing the needs of both partners throughout, instead of the all too common message in many books of this genre that women must be willing to change their nature, exchange their style of communication, or give up their hopes of an emotional relationship if they don't want to stay single. If you want to boost your hope that you can have the relationship you want without having to become someone you're not, this is a great book for you! Dr. Weinberg writes in a way that is appealing to both men and women without being condescending, and offers expertise and practical insights that allow the reader to find his/her own way. There's no attitude that men are bad, stupid, or helpless and need to be manipulated, condemned, or excused. Yes, he often points out that certain fears or wants from men may be exaggerated or over the top, but he does so in a way that is non-critical and factual in manner. This book lives up to its title in that it does not encourage playing games, rather it proposes working to meet each other half way so that both partners are satisfied. It is primarily targeted towards women, but it's about how to help a man feel okay with having his needs met, not coercing him into changing his true nature or \"we know what's best for him\". Dr. Weinberg offers easy to understand explanations for common behaviors and conflicts, and allows enough room in his examples so that the reader can apply those scenarios to real life situations. My only criticism of this work is the section on sex in which Dr. Weinberg suggests that sex early on in a relationship is more likely to build connection. Earlier on in the book, he gives examples of when a woman may want to cut her losses before she gets too invested. This seems contradictory as females are commonly known to associate more emotion and create attachment through physical intimacy.  Though he says the why, when, and how of sex should be up to the woman, he misses the boat with the \"earlier the better\" as he fails to address the emotional costs (not to mention medical dangers) uncommitted sex can have for ladies. If his advice parallels kissing frogs...well, you can see how this is not likely to go over well with most women. If the relationship was guaranteed success, then sure!, the earlier the better may be the way to go. But as Dr. Weinberg points out, there are no guarantees even if you do everything \"right\".  Final take: it's one of the best I've read in this genre, could read it again with equal enthusiasm, but weary of the sex advice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best relationship books I've ever read", "unixReviewTime": 1305417600, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2011"}

Have been dating for 2 and half years, the other day I playfully pulled all my rings out and asked my SO to put them on me. He broke out in a sweat, became really nervous ( a classic case of commitmentphobia) and begged me to put the rings away. I became cold as an iceberg as a result. He pleaded and swore love but this time this was a little different. I never got the apologies and or the flowers the next day. And he just seemed annoyed and tired of being pressured in to things. He said, you corner me! To which I replied, well, all the months of unmet needs and neglect, do you realize that in this way YOU also are cornering me??!!For a background info, my SO is an older very handsome man who just became a widower 2 years ago. I had been waiting for him to get out of his grieving rut but on getting out of the rut, he just seemed to drift away.One could say it is the rebound relationship, but not quite as it has been 2 and half years and we still have GREAT chemistry.  We have a very solid dating relationship and are slowly talking and trying to build a life together. But he refuses to take any steps further or make a formal commitment (e.g marriage). So I do know that we do have potential and I desperately scoured books in order to find the tidbit to fix my relationship.This book explains beautifully what we have always known but could not sistematically put a a finger on it or use it on practical applications.( With this SO I learned that if you think about the guy hard enough and sometimes a time out is what you need- you will KNOW what is going on with him.) Women should train their sixth sense enough to KNOW some things. Of course the way they raise girls including the way I was raised, we are thrown in to high stake careers. Not much time to develop empathy nor the nurturing side. Much to the contrary, a career in corporate America will make sure that any of the traditional feminine traits are wiped out for good. Ladies are guys with a different set of organs that is it.  But I digress.And this book explains FINALLY WHY men pull away, WHAT makes them break out in a cold sweat, and most importantly- what you can do about it WITHOUT playing games.I do agree with another reviewer that the part about becoming physical quickly  in this book is a bit much- I do endorse the part where you should try as much as you can too extract a commitment from the guy BEFORE jumping in bed- which is largely talked about elsewhere but not in this book. ( I was trying to extract a commitment but my SO HURRIED everything along  SO much, here I am 2 and half years later, stuck in a relationship that was going nowhere fast. So buyer beware on doing anything FAST physically.)BUT on the flip side, I have never seen such good explanation as to why it is a BAD IDEA to play hard to get. Become genuinely involved and busy-yes. Just playing hard to get and creating artificial hurdles- not a good idea. This book explains that men will resent you for making them suffer  and wait so much and eventually they may even want to shag yo. But they will now withhold what you want and they will do that out of resentment for you making them into such fools. Playing hard to get or throwing unnecessary hurdles will eventually come back to bite you and not in a good way.I implemented the techniques for conversation that this book mentions, with IMMEDIATE results. My SO now seems to ENJOY the time we share much more. And then I also was able to extract from him, that the way I treat my cat (I treat her like a cat, still very nice, hug her and kiss her every day, she is allowed in my bed and everything) - he feels that I don't give my cat enough attention. And this may be a deal breaker because my SO is set on treating all his animals as a human beings (NOT!).I also started implementing the final section of the book where it talks about how to assert yourself,  how ask for your &#34;rights&#34; and how to communicate your needs with your SO without DESTROYING the relationship. I always chickened out standing up for myself, but this book teaches you to go on a debate WITHOUT wiping our your &#34;opponent&#34;. I do that in my business dealings all the time. It is called &#34;not burning bridges&#34;. Explain to the other party WHY you have become upset, say- I don't appreciate this or I don't appreciate that, but NEVER make comments about his or her character (you are just a scoundrel, you were just set out to cheat me, you are a liar and a cheat ) and so forth. Being unhappy with a situation means that as long as you fix the situation we are friends. Whereas if you attack the other person's character- well you are never going to be able to take that back and one should never do this. Both in professional or personal dealings.The  book &#34;Too good to leave.

The difference is men believe that to admit they want a permanent partner is not considered part of the cultural image and thus too feminine so most males hide their inner feelings as an alpha menace to their masculinity.  Dr. Weinberg believes culture forces this role to include women placing the man of their dreams in a situation by comparing his strengths and weaknesses to his rivals.WHY MEN WON'T COMMIT: GETTING WHAT YOU BOTH WANT WITHOUT PLAYING GAMES provides a straight forward guide for frustrated women to enable their mate to find his feelings (&quot;gut reactions&quot;) by altering her behavior.  Before feminists scream &quot;no Jane&quot; chauvinism and machos play Tarzan, the key in Dr. Weinberg's help guide is to accept that the male is the &quot;weaker sex&quot; so that the stronger female must take charge by being the relationship caretaker reaching through the stereotype stud to his inner being.  This is an easy to follow guide that wastes little if any space assisting frustrated women with solid advice.Harriet Klausner", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "strong relationship guide", "unixReviewTime": 1049673600, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2003"}

This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie \"left-handed,\" vs. a truth which is \"right-handed\" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance.

The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work, this is mostly a book of action, not intricate plot development. In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist.

He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud \"Huh? That's it?!\" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for.

He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves \"Vader's Fist?\"  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

Originally titled \"John Barton,\" it's a book with many elements - starting out as a exploration of the lives of the poor in Manchester, England and ending as a more traditional love story with a focus on economic justice.Mary is John's daughter, a young dressmaker who enters into a flirtation with the son of a factory owner.  She hopes to marry him and rescue herself and her father from poverty.  Jem, a factory foreman who is the son of one of her father's closest friends, is in love with Mary.  As economic conditions worsen in Manchester, Mary's father is radicalized and drawn into Chartism (not incredibly well known now, this was a working class labor movement).As all these elements come together, Gaskell mixes romance, a murder trial, a strike, and heartrending descriptions of poverty and death.  There are a handful of characters who are economically well-off and they're not presented unsympathetically, but it's clear that Gaskell's heart was with the working class characters of this novel.  Their dialect is carefully presented (with glosses in the text, provided by her husband) and her desire is clearly that her readers would understand - if not condone - how their lives are lived.  Esther, an aunt of Mary's who has become a prostitute, is even given a chance to explain her actions and why she has made the choices that she has made.While I did enjoy this book, parts of the second half did drag for me.  Gaskell had not yet mastered the art of authorial injections and the constant breaking in began to feel a bit intrusive.  There were also some bits of high-Victoriana I could have done without (a \"fit of madness\" that leaves one ill for a few weeks, etc).Wives and Daughters, from the end of her career, was a much stronger novel.

The characters appear to SHOUT at one another from time to time.One more drawback to this edition of The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu: The characters' dialogue is presented without quotation marks, so the reader has to guess where the dialogue stops and the narration begins. That's not hard to do, just annoying.Could be a fine edition with an active table of contents and a bit more attention to the text.

PORT MUNGO follows the line of his successful THE ASYLUM, DR. HAGGARD'S DISEASE, MARTHA PEAKE, and SPIDER,  and despite the fact that he can be considered the progenitor for unlikable characters, he explores the psyches of these odd creatures with such skill that their darker sides often mesmerize us.Jack Rathbone is a 17-year-old youth in the UK who aspires to be an artist and lives with his sister Gin (the narrator of the story) who is devoted to her younger brother in a near pathologic manner.  Jack encounters Vera Savage, an exotic bohemian painter from Scotland who is well shown in the UK, and falls under the spell of his older chanteuse/alcoholic/free love personage.  The two become entwined as sexual partners and Jack encourages Vera to move to New York where they will open an 'American Studio' in the wildness of a new country and Jack will learn painting (and other lessons) from Vera.Once in Manhattan their painting is delayed by Vera's insatiable need to be the center of attention among new artsy acquaintances and her alcoholism triggers periods of absence.  Feeling confined by New York the two decide to seek other locations to pursue their art, and after a brief stay in Havana, Cuba they find the perfect isolation in Port Mungo - a seedy, smarmy, decadent Maughamesque spot in the Gulf of Honduras.  There they paint, drink, carouse, and while Jack develops a painting style of 'tropicalism', Vera begins to follow her sexual needs in adventures away from Port Mungo.  Always reuniting after these trysts and fights, they eventually have a daughter Peg and some years later another daughter Anna.  Vera soon deserts her family, leaving Jack (and on occasion his sister Gin) to raise the girls. Peg is more in the mold of her mother and is worshipped by Jack, but Peg dies in a quasi-mysterious fashion plunging Jack into a deep depression.Jack returns to New York to live with his sister Gin, and scathing rumors result in daughter Anna being adopted by her uncle who sees Jack as an inadequate parent.  Time passes until Anna returns as a young woman to re-enter Jack's life - older, wiser, and needy.  From this point on the story passes rapidly, enriched by characters who all deftly interplay with the strange history of what really happened in Port Mungo. Vera's absence is explained, Peg's death is clarified, and the true nature of each of these fascinating characters is painted before our eyes.McGrath leaves no one free of fault, of the ability to have a dark side, or to demonstrate that their chameleon lives can shed a dermis to reveal the core animal beneath.  He writes so well that once the story is started it is difficult to put aside, so wary are we of the tension always mounting.  He understands art and the artistic mind and has depicted the artist/model relationship as well as anyone writing today.  You may not like the characters in this book, but they will remain indelibly stamped on your mind.  Here is another fine work by one of our better novelists writing today.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Art with a Darker Palette", "unixReviewTime": 1098057600, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2004"}

Michael Henry Heim has restudied and again translated this brief but poignant novella with an English version more in tune with Mann's novella and certainly, finally free from all the societal homophobic restrictions that have shrouded previous translations.  This is the  tale of a writer - Gustav von Aschenbach - in his fifties who feels the need for exotic travels to break his writer's block,  and after many aborted attempts to find the right place, comes to Venice and not only falls under its spell but also finds his sublimated desires for pure beauty as focused on young men awakened in his encounter with the young Polish boy Tadzio.  This story has been translated into other languages, transformed into film by Luchino Visconti and made into the last opera of Sir Benjamin Britten.  But though the simple story has captivated our minds for many years, it has never been presented in so eloquent a fashion as in this Heim translation.  To wit: \"On a personal level, too, art is life intensified: it delights more deeply, consumes more rapidly; it engraves the traces of imaginary and intellectual adventure on the countenance of its servant and in the long run, for all the monastic calm of his external existence, leads to self-indulgence, over refinement, lethargy, and a restless curiosity that a lifetime of wild passions and pleasures could scarcely engender.\"  When he first encounters Tadzio \"...he was infused with a paternal affection, the attraction that one who begets beauty by means of self-sacrifice [a writer] feels for one who is inherently beautiful.\" And \"Was it not common knowledge that the sun diverts our attention from the intellectual to the sensual?  It benumbs and bewitches both reason and memory such that the soul in its  elation quite forgets its true nature and clings with rapt delight to the fairest of sun-drenched objects, nay, only with the aid of the corporeal can it ascend to more lofty considerations.\"Once von Aschenbach accepts the fact that he is in love with the idea of Tadzio he sets about to quash rumors of the threat that cholera is invading Venice to keep his Polish lad from leaving the city (and von Aschenbach) with his family.  \"Thus the addled traveler could no longer think or care about anything but pursuing unrelentingly the object that had so inflamed him, dreaming of him in his absence, and, as is the lover's wont, speaking tender words to his mere shadow.  Loneliness, the foreign environment, and the joy of a belated and profound exhilaration prompted him, persuaded him to indulge without shame or remorse in the most distasteful behavior, as when returning from Venice [to the Lido] late one evening he had paused at the beautiful boy's door on the second floor of the hotel and pressed his forehead against the hinge in drunken rapture, unable to tear himself away even at the risk of being discovered and caught.\"Has Heim 'changed' Mann's story in to a more titillating one? No, indeed not! But he has rescued it from the mere Apollonian/Dionysian rhetoric with which  other translations have cloaked the sensual aspects of the story.  Here von Aschenbach becomes a fully three-dimensional character, one whose life up to the entry into Venice is understood and appreciated as a writer of brilliance, and one whose epiphany of the Eros submerged in this intellectual psyche blossoms in the most credible, tender way that far from being transformed into a 'pedophile', he is instead in that wondrous plane where awakened emotions of love and longing dwell.Michael Cunningham has written a beautiful introduction to this new translation and, as we have come to expect from this contemporary gifted man of letters, his words are warm and befitting his admiration for this work by Thomas Mann.  This is a book to be read and read again, and should you have other versions of DEATH IN VENICE in your library, that is all the more reason to pleasure your mind with the genius of this translation.

And yet Heim's update on the classic Lowe-Porter translation has made Mann's Aschenbach more fully human, more tragic and less comic, still every bit as pompous and self-justifying, more insidiously real.  It's a triumph of the translator's art.To me, anyhow, Mann's book has always been at least as much about the language, the inner self-talk of Aschenbach, as it has been about the story line or plot.  It is fascinating to see how the author enters the mind of a man who has spent his life in rigid self-denial, self-deception really, and slowly - and not without considerable struggle from his ego against it - expands his consciousness.  By book's end Aschenbach has not only found himself, he can no longer deny himself, he accepts himself as he is and then of course he dies.  The journey he undertakes - not just from serious and constricted Germany to a holiday resort on the Lido in Venice, but from stuffy and self-important man living a lie, a life of 'despites', to allowing himself to be fully conscious of one true emotion and impulse and allowing it, even willing it to take him entirely over, to free him from himself, is the thing.Well, it's a spellbinding book, and one which rewards close rereading.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "transcendant translation", "unixReviewTime": 1133222400, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2005"}

She is talked and participates in a seance led by a clairvoint, mystical, magical, very handsome, seemingly  perfect man named Michael. Following the seance she believes this Michael as the greatest thing since white bread, that can do no wrong. She succumbs to everything he wants her to do,  and she falls for it very naively, it made me want to grab her by the shoulders and shake at least a little sense into her. Hopefully her character changes or disappears in volume two, yes this is a series. The other part of the book, the two stories are changed every couple of chapters, is where the better writer takes over and leads the reader into the Saxon, Normandy era of the middle ages and progresses in his quest to pursue eternal life. This part of the book is exciting, as it shows him meeting kings, magicians, alchemists, he also finds torment, imprisonment, sorcery, gods, beautiful women and more. If the entire book were written this way ,in my opinion, would have been much better reading.

It thereupon became the influential, prestigious Edgar award-winning, British Broadcasting Company, and, later, Public Broadcasting System television series \"Prime Suspect,\" starring Helen Mirren. That book, and tv show, were infused with the gritty realism of the English cop shop as it then was: La Plante researched it by interviewing the highest-ranking English police woman of the time.  Book and tv series were also infused with the gritty realism of some of the meanest streets to be found in England at the time.

Joe Vadalma is a good writer. He is able to make this tall tale interesting and even believable. Little by little, the reader begins to see the terrible fate that may await Melody as she is drawn in by the charms of Michael. Michael himself is a fascinating character. I particularly enjoyed the discussions he has with historical famous people down through the ages--these scenes of philosophical and political discourse are especially well done. As an author of several published novels myself, my hat is off to the author for these scenes.By about 2/3 of the way through the book, the author has been able to build the tension to the point that it's hard to stop reading. The reader wants to keep going to reach the shattering climax, which to me was totally unexpected, a real surprise.

The small town contains no measurable crime, a much greater than average life-span, no international business chains as everything is locally owned, no federal money is received not even Medicare or Pell Grants, the marriage rate is very low, but offspring very high and no major religion has taken hold. However, the oddest fact is that these trends can be traced back to the Civil War.Harry's findings reach NSA; they become concerned with this oddity in the center of the Bible Belt especially since the objective of the President of the United States is to imbue Christian family values as the Bill of Rights.  NSA field agents Daniel Stenning and Shirley Rostervick are sent to Masterville to uncover and destroy this heretical conspiracy in the middle of the United States that the POTUS and the NSA believe is the biggest threat to national security since the wall fell.Using hyperbole to highlight the extreme of the fundamentalist religious right movement, Darrell Bain provides a powerful political thriller.  The story line showcases a central government that feels so strongly in the end state of Christian based federalism that it leads the people to a restrictive faith in which the means to get there do not matter.  This includes beating the bushes to thwart a small town whose residents are living together in harmony as that is not necessarily a pious life style.

For some reason when people think of \"family business\" they think of that particular family. Be that as it may This is a book that tells of Nepotism in history and it's effects.It must be understood that the author has a pretty wide definition of Nepotism. What most people think of, is the misuse of an office to gain privileges for family and friends by corrupt means. The author extends that to any kind of family traditionalism. And says there are good effects as well as bad effects. I can see his point. I have never quite felt the contempt for or indignation at \"rich kids\" that some have felt for it always seemed a little like blaming people for their ancestry. And I have never felt particularly horrified by the occasional dynastic politician. It seemed to me to kind of humanize politics, and as the alternative would be to have politicians who wanted power or thought they were \"what the country needed\" perhaps a politician who is running because daddy wants him to isn't so bad as long as he has no institutionalized advantage from it.As the author points out, a strict meritocracy, should such an impossibility exist, has the danger of creating a ruling class that feels over independent and has little sense of responsibility(this can be corrected, by the way, by instilling esprit de corps in a given meritocracy but perhaps that cannot be institutionalized until it reaches into the family structure in a manner similar to Roman families or Jane Austen style naval families).The book doesn't just cover government families which is what we would think of, but a wide range of traditional family occupations including, perhaps inevitably, the Mafia. It shows how \"Nepotism\" rightly understood can produce a drive to succeed just as wrongly understood it can produce corruption.As is common in such books I liked the historical interest more then \"the message\"It's basic point of course is that \"nepotism\"(as the author defines it) is part of human nature, and it might be better for a society to take advantage of it then to try to destroy it.

Robertson", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children, edited by Joseph Bucklin Bishop, is a delightfully charming book!  Roosevelt had 6 children, and he made it a habit to write to them once a week if they were away at school or if he was away from home.  The letters in this book were written between May 1898 and December 1911.  Most of them are from his White House years.  A few of the letters are to family and friends, and they are interesting in that they are a window on what was going on in the Roosevelt family, such as their Christmas celebrations.  Roosevelt sometimes included comical illustrations, which are reproduced in this book.  Shortly before he died, Roosevelt helped with the planning of this book and claimed that \"'I would rather have this book published than anything that has ever been written about me.'\"Letters to His Children is fascinating for a number of reasons.  First, it's a fun way to read about his White House years.  TR writes to his children of many important events, like his secret negotiations for a peace between warring Japan and Russia.  But TR always claimed that no family enjoyed the White House as much as his, and that also comes through in his letters.  He writes about daily walks in the White House gardens and horse rides through Rock Creek Park.  He also describes the many games that he played with his sons and their friends in the White House:  \"We had obstacle races, hide-and-go-seek, blind-man's bluff, and everything else.\"  His children often ambushed him with pillows for a good pillow-fight.  He writes to Archie about Mike, a \"delightful new dog,\" who is \"an extraordinary ratter, and kills a great many rats in the White House, in the cellars and on the lower floor among the machinery.\"  We learn about Quentin riding his horse to school in Washington, DC and about Quentin and his mischievous friends putting spit-balls on the White House portraits.As Roosevelt's sons get older, his letters start to offer more advice.  When Ted wants to play football, TR tries to get his son to put sports in the proper perspective.  \"I am delighted to have you play football.  I believe in rough, manly sports.  But I don not believe in them if they degenerate into the sole end of any one's existence.  I don't want you to sacrifice standing well in your studies to any over-athleticism; and I need not tell you that character counts for a great deal more than either intellect or body in winning success in life.  Athletic proficiency is a mighty good servant, and like so many other good servants, a mighty bad master.\"  He also tries to talk Ted out of going to West Point or the Naval Academy.  TR believes that without a war, his son would have little chance of advancement in the military.Letters to His Children is a testament to TR's love for his children, his wife, and his family \"and for all living things, birds, animals, trees, flowers, and nature in all moods and aspects.  But the love of children and family and home was above all.\"  Perhaps in the end, this becomes his most important legacy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Delightfully charming...", "unixReviewTime": 1291593600, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2010"}
